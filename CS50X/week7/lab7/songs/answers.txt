If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura? Quite the mainstream pop fan, I would assume. I joke. The average tempo is 120, so this person likes relatively fast tempo songs. The danceability is slightly high, this is a dancing person, but not too much.
The energy is 0.65, this complements my position about dancing. The valence average is in the middle ground, tending slightly to lower values. I'm not much familiar with the aura in spotify, but I would assume this is fan of music that it's in the middle ground between energetic and just vibing along (but not completely chill! the profile is towards a dancing), liking both positive and negative feelings in music, be it cheerful songs or more angry, sad songs.
I have to note that I'm brazillian so we are a bit too energetic when it comes to music, so there is this cultural difference.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose? Well, this isn't a weighted average. We don't have informations about how many minutes per song, so we can only assume that all songs were listened equally.
The chances are this is not true. One time, my top 1 had so many hours that I was a 0.1% listener. That was quite a difference from the number 5 of the list. Also, if we would like to group by moods we would absolutely need this data to create a stratification of moods.
