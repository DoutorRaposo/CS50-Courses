Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
In Men's World Cup, Denmarks position changed drastically from just 10 to 100.
Sweden changed quite a bit. But I guess it "stabilized" starting from a 1000. Brazil was a favorite in 1000 and below but that wasn't the case in every one of the higher simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
I guess 10000, because even if 10, 100 and 1000 are basically the same time (favouring the case of 1000), there were discrepancies of almost 2 pp between 1000 and 10000.
And 10000 is much closer to the higher simulations, sub 1 pp differences.
Also, even if it costs 3x as much as the previous ones, it is as accurate as 10^5 and 10^6, and they start to cost much more.
I'm from Brazil and didn't like that after 1000 in my simulations at least Brazil always loses to Belgium. Sour reminder of what actually happened that year.
